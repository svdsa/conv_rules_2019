<h1>DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA
<br>2019 National Convention
<br>PRECONVENTION RULES</h1>

## Delegate Credentials

1. The NPC has established a target goal of 1,000 delegates to the 2019 DSA National Convention. Of the total number of delegates, 100 delegates will be reserved for at-large delegates who are not members of a chartered chapter. The remaining delegates will be distributed among chapters using a delegate-to-member ratio of 1-to-51, or _one delegate per every 51 members_, based on chapter membership numbers determined by the National Director 4 months prior to the Convention (Tuesday, April 2nd, 2019). Locals with fewer than 51 members will be apportioned one delegate. Locals with at least 51 members will get one delegate for every 51 members or greater fraction thereof. That is, the number of delegates allocated to each local is the number of members of the local, divided by 51, rounded to the nearest whole number. As an example, a local with 149 members will get 3 delegates, and a local with 199 members will get 4 delegates. The National Director shall include these calculations in a delegate apportionment announcement to all members.
2. Locals may elect alternates so as to ensure that their delegation is represented in full strength, even if initially-elected delegates are unable to attend. Alternate delegates only gain voting rights if an elected delegate needs to surrender their responsibilities for any reason, either before the Convention or during. Some alternate delegates shall be allowed to attend the
Convention, regardless of whether their duties as alternate delegates are needed. Observers cannot under any circumstances get voting rights, although some, such as National Political Committee (NPC) members, have speaking rights.
3. The National Office shall inform locals of the delegates apportioned to them as of four months prior to the start of the convention, Tuesday, April 2nd.
4. Locals shall conduct and supervise their own elections of Convention delegates and alternate delegates in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DSA Constitution and Bylaws not before the apportionment of delegates and no later than June 18th, 45 days prior to the start of convention. Locals will be advised that delegate elections should use a proportional representation method of election, and of DSA Bylaws Article VI, Section 3, which requires that they use the Hare method upon petition. Any member in good standing of a local may run for delegate and vote in their local’s delegate election. The National Office will offer to locals use of _OpaVote.com_ or a similar online election system to help them conduct their delegate election, and will publish this offer in a communication to the full national membership.
5. Each local must report the result of its elections in writing to the National Office no later than June 23rd. The report must include full contact information, including an email address, for all delegates and should indicate if any delegate is requesting full or partial relief from the Travel Share requirements (outlined in future rules documents).
6. The National Office shall conduct and supervise the election of at-large delegates. A call for candidates for at-large delegates shall be sent to all at-large members no later than Friday, March 1st. At-large delegate nominations will be open 60 days, through Tuesday, April 30th. Candidates for delegate may submit a brief statement to be made available to voters. If at the
close of nominations the number of candidates is less than or equal to the number of positions (taking into account the diversity requirements), the candidates will be considered elected by acclamation. Otherwise, no later than Thursday, May 2nd, the National Office shall administer an online Single Transferable Vote election using OpaVote.com or similar online voting system. Every at-large member will be eligible to vote in the election. Voting will be open through Thursday, May 23rd. As required by DSA bylaws, no more than one-half of the available positions for at-large delegates may be filled by men and one-fifth of the available positions must be reserved for national and racial minorities. Those candidates who have been elected shall be immediately informed of their election by the National Office.
7. No person not in good standing as a DSA member through the end of the convention may be seated as a delegate or alternate delegate.
8. Based on the reports of local delegate elections and the outcome of the at-large elections conducted by the National Office, the National Office shall prepare a temporary roster of delegates and alternate delegates, which shall be sent to delegates, alternate delegates, locals, commissions and officers of DSA no later than Friday, July 12th.
9. Challenges to the credentials of any delegate or alternate must be submitted in writing to the National Office no later than Friday, July 19th and shall be forwarded to the Credentials Committee appointed by the NPC for consideration. Challenges must either name individual delegates or alternates from one delegation, or may name any one entire delegation, and must include a reason for the challenge that applies to all the credentials challenged. Challenges may include replacement(s) for the delegate or alternate challenged, or challenges may seek to seat additional delegate(s) or alternate(s) as part of a delegation. However, challenges that would result in a delegation exceeding its apportioned number of delegates will not be valid.
10. At the opening plenary, the Credentials Committee shall report to the Convention any challenge(s) filed according to rule 9 and may report its recommendation concerning them. There shall be no more than one speaker for and one speaker against each credentials challenge.
11. The delegates listed on the Temporary Roster of Delegates shall vote on the Credentials Committee's recommendations, except that no delegate may vote on a challenge to his or her own credentials. Upon acceptance of the Credentials Committee those persons listed on the Temporary Roster of Delegates who are not subject to successful credentials challenge shall become the Permanent Roster of Delegates.
12. Each Local delegation and the At-Large delegation shall elect a chair who shall be responsible for official communications with the Convention Secretary (see Rules regarding Convention Secretary in subseqent documents).
